# IMCXXI

> Implement Modules C++ Interfaces

## Reminder (for all projects)

- self organization for deep C++ learning purposes
- use only core C++ language (no compiler extensions)
- only C++ modules
- not use any library (including std libraries implementation, no stl)
- use latest C++ standard (last standard version release year + 2, not this is C++23, in 2028 change to C++26)
- use only CMake as building tool
- sure to exclude linking with std libraries
- support only windows and linux os (for now)
- support only AMD64 platform
- no backward compatibility (main branches would break a lot)
- adjasted SEMVER versioning
- all libraries is under namespace imcxxi::lib
- all executables is under namespace imcxxi::app

## Repositories

> most of this are plans

- **`template`**: template repository base for all projects
- **`c`**: C library implementation (no std related, namespace c, just extern "C" still use modules)
- **`cxx`**: C++ core library implementation (no std related, namespace cxx)
- **`ruin`**: game engine
- **`pog`: _Parts of Gore_ game based on `ruin` engine
